                Sleep is the cornerstone of both physical and mental wellbeing. Many people use sleep apps and devices such as Apple Watch, SleepCycle, and SleepWatch, to track their slumber, hoping to improve their sleep. These modern tools offer a suite of features, from soothing sleep sounds to analytics detailing sleep duration, REM cycles, and sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep). Yet, despite this wealth of data, most apps fall short in showing WHY you had a good or bad night of sleep. You are left to figure out why you woke up several times in the night, or why your REM sleep percentage was so low for one particular night.
