                In our modern age, it is nearly impossible to stray away from our phones. We use phones for almost everything: to communicate with friends and family, keep up with current affairs, and provide entertainment. Many of us catch ourselves endlessly scrolling through our phones in the dark before we fall asleep each night. For some it might be a comforting nightly routine, but for others it may feel like a dooming habit. From countless studies, it is commonly known that using the phone right before bed can be detrimental to our quality of sleep. Specifcially, bluelight emitted by smartphone screens suppresses melatonin secretion which reduces sleepiness and disrupts our sleep cycles.  Do you sleep with your phone within close reach? Do you use your phone at all before falling asleep?
