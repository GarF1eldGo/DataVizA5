# SlumberStates: Plotting Your Path to Quality Sleep

What is one experience everyone shares? After a hectic day of work, we all turn off the lights, snuggle into our blankets, and fall into the enchantment of sleep. Yet, in the whirlwind of our daily routines, the art of perfecting sleep eludes us. We aim to enable exploration, guiding users to understand and improve their sleep, key to reducing stress and living a good life. Through interactive toggles, users can undergo a “choose your own adventure” style that explores different factors and their impacts on sleep duration and quality.  

How many hours do you sleep?

While many articles focus on why sleep is important, most do not answer the question of how to sleep better. While many people use sleep apps to improve their sleep, sleep apps which mostly track sleep duration and REM sleep percentage do not actually tell you WHY you had a bad night of sleep. We aim to create an interactive and personalized journey that explores factors such as stress and alcohol consumption that influence sleep and create a prototype sleep app allows users to track these habits to improve their sleep.
