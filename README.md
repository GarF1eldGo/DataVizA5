# The Art of Perfect Sleep

What is one experience everyone shares? After a hectic day of work, we all turn off the lights, snuggle into our blankets, and fall into the enchantment of sleep. Yet, in the whirlwind of our daily routines, the art of perfecting sleep eludes us. We aim to enable exploration, guiding users to understand and improve their sleep, key to reducing stress and living a good life. Through interactive toggles, users can undergo a “choose your own adventure” style that explores different factors and their impacts on sleep duration and quality.  

A New York Times article, “[The Secrets to Good Sleep](https://www.nytimes.com/paidpost/samsung/the-secrets-to-good-sleep-according-to-data-from-millions.html)” inspired our interest in sleep. We loved its storytelling approach to exploring sleep, emphasizing smooth transitions and engaging sensory elements. The clickable features in the NYT article “[Sleep Better at Every Age](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/07/well/live/sleep-better-age.html)” were similarly intriguing, leading us to design customizable data filters for our project. In the 2022 study by [Yu Ikeda and Emi Morita](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9529619/), we learned that lifestyle factors such as smartphone usage contributes to reduced sleep efficiency (proportion of time in bed spent asleep) and is correlated with sleep duration and quality. We aim to build on these projects by focusing on how to get a good night’s sleep (rather than why), researching how physical and mental habits such as phone usage, alcohol consumption, and stress affect our sleep patterns and quality. In particular:

1. How can we optimize our sleep, both in terms of duration and quality?
2. What routine adjustments can significantly improve sleep quality?
3. Are there significant variations in sleep duration and sleep quality among different ages, genders, or occupations?

Our datasets include [Sleep, Health. and Lifestyle Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data), [Sleep and PhoneTime Study](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlomuscio/sleepstudypilot/data?select=README.md), and [Sleep Efficiency Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency/data).
